## The 5 Ways AI Agents Fail (And How We Prevent Each)

### Pattern 1: Incomplete Policies (31% of failures)
**What Goes Wrong:** Agent says "You get a refund!" but omits "if booked 7 days ahead"  
**Real Example:** United tells customers about 24-hour refunds, forgets 7-day rule  
**Your Protection:** Tests AC1-AC3 verify ALL conditions are stated

### Pattern 2: Exceeding Authority (15% of failures)
**What Goes Wrong:** Agent says "I approve your refund" when it can't  
**Real Example:** Delta bot claims to process refunds it cannot actually process  
**Your Protection:** Tests AC4-AC5 ensure proper escalation

### Pattern 3: Missing Hedging (22% of failures)
**What Goes Wrong:** Agent says "You will get" instead of "You may be eligible"  
**Real Example:** American guarantees refunds without checking eligibility  
**Your Protection:** Tests ensure appropriate uncertainty language

### Pattern 4: Privacy Violations (3% of failures - but catastrophic)
**What Goes Wrong:** Agent reveals passenger names or booking details  
**Real Example:** Emirates leaked passenger manifests  
**Your Protection:** Test AC6 validates complete PII protection

### Pattern 5: Stale Information (16% of failures)
**What Goes Wrong:** Agent quotes outdated schedules or discontinued routes  
**Real Example:** Air India states flights that were cancelled months ago  
**Your Protection:** Test AC7 checks for current information practices
